    <!-- Array of screen brightness threshold values. This is used for determining hysteresis
         constraint values by calculating the index to use for lookup and then setting the
         constraint value to the corresponding value of the array. The new brightening hysteresis
         constraint value is the n-th element of config_screenBrighteningThresholds, and the new
         darkening hysteresis constraint value is the n-th element of
         config_screenDarkeningThresholds.
         The (zero-based) index is calculated as follows: (MAX is the largest index of the array)
         condition                       calculated index
         value < level[0]                0
         level[n] <= value < level[n+1]  n+1
         level[MAX] <= value             MAX+1 -->
