    <!-- Array of hysteresis constraint values for brightening, represented as tenths of a
         percent. The length of this array is assumed to be one greater than
         config_screenThresholdLevels. The brightening threshold is calculated as
         screenBrightness * (1.0f + CONSTRAINT_VALUE). When the new screen brightness is higher
         than this threshold, it is applied. See the config_screenThresholdLevels description for
         how the constraint value is chosen. -->
